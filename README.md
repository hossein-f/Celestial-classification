# Celestial-classification
In this project we apply some of the machine learning algorithms to SDSS database to classify the celestial objects( stars, galaxis and quasar) in astrophysics. We use the Data Release 12 that includes optical spectra and catalog data (parameters measured from images and spectra, such as magnitudes and redshifts).We retrieved data from SDSS and applied different machine learning algorithm to classify these objects.
