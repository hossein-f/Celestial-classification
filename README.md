## Celestial-classification

## Overview

Classification of the celestial objects (stars, galaxis and quasars) is an important issue in astrophysics. It provides a better undrestanding of the universe and its content. In particuar, using bright quasars as reference points, we can create the largest and most detailed three-dimensional map of the universe. 

I utilise the DR12 (the final data release of the SDSS-III) release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for this purpose. I use both spectroscopic and photometric data from DR12 database.  


For our classification models, we train a dataset comprising the u−g,u−g, g−r,g−r, r−ir−i and i−zi−z colours of 47,401 stars, 415,634 galaxies and 71,031 quasars with spectral classifications.
